      Well, we're really a group of Imperial College London students with a
      passion for plants and the environment. We saw an opportunity to combine
      our software and hardware experience to try and help you take care of your
      plants.

          Now THAT is true, but we love user experience even more. We talk about
          it all the time and saw that the existing products in the market were
          either too technical or not user-friendly enough. As plant
          enthusiasts, we understand not everyone has the time in their busy
          schedules to properly care for their plants. So, we built a Gro - a
          device that makes everyone's fingers green!

          Word. But good **code** _can_ solve a lots of problems, too. New _and_
          old. Thatâ€™s why we help beginners get started with web development
          through free content and tools, like this theme. We also believe [the
          JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) might be one solid pillar on which we
          build that future.
