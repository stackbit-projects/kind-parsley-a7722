    headline: We are Gro
    subtitle: >
      Well, we're really a group of Imperial College London students with a
      passion for plants and the environment. We saw an opportunity to combine
      our software and hardware experience to try and help you take care of your
      plants.

      - title: We love plants
        description: >
          Now THAT is true, but we love user experience even more. We talk about
          it all the time and saw that the existing products in the market were
          either too technical or not user-friendly enough. As plant
          enthusiasts, we understand not everyone has the time in their busy
          schedules to properly care for their plants. So, we built a Gro - a
          device that makes everyone's fingers green!

      - title: We think plants are the future
        description: "RHS retail reported a\_houseplant\_sales growth of 50% in 2018, driven largely by foliage plant sales which have doubled. With this increase, we realised that the importance of caring for these plants was more important than ever. Studies have shown that placing greenery in your workspace increases productivity - and there's nothing we love more at Gro than working hard (oh yeh and plants too!)\n"
